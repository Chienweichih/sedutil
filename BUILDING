sedutil is built using autotools and make.

Depending on the distribution, you might need to download some of thises.
For instance, in a new Fedora 42 running ppc64le, this `dnf` command:

sudo dnf install autoconf make g++ automake systemd-devel libnvme-devel

in Ubuntu 24.04:

sudo apt install build-essential autoconf libsystemd-dev libnvme-dev


sedutil is built using autotools and make.
steps:
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-silent-rules
make
------------------------
This will also build the PBA ignore it.

If you get an error building that says Version.h is missing
you need to make all. This is an issue with how autotools handles
built sources and dependencies.
